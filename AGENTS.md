# Agent instructions for this repository

## Project summary
- The repository contains bookmarklets for changing YouTube playback speed, currently stored in `bookmarklets.txt`.
- Each entry is a short description followed by a `javascript:` URL that can be saved as a browser bookmark.

## Key files
- `bookmarklets.txt`: Source of bookmarklet definitions and descriptions.
- `README.md`: User-facing documentation that should stay in sync with the bookmarklets provided.

## Workflow expectations
- After completing **each** work request, review and update this `AGENTS.md` file to capture any new project context, workflows, or conventions learned.
- Every time you run, you must also review and update `README.md` to ensure the repository documentation is current with the code or content changes.

## Editing guidance
- Keep bookmarklet entries in `bookmarklets.txt` readable and separated by blank lines.
- If adding new bookmarklets, include a clear, short description above the `javascript:` URL.
